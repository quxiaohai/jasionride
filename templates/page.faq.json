Do not underinflate or overinflate your tires. Low pressure may result in loss of control, and overinflated tires may burst. Failure to always maintain the air pressure rating indicated on pneumatic tires may result in the tire and/or wheel failure.<br/>Even tires equipped with built-in, flat-preventative tire liners, like those that come with bikes from Jasion, can and do get flats from punctures, pinches, impact, and other causes. When tire wear becomes evident or a flat tire is discovered, tires and/or tubes must be replaced before operating the bike or injury to operators and/or damage to your bike from heybike could occur.<br/>When changing a tire or tube, ensure that all air pressure has been removed from the inner tube prior to removing the tire from the rim. Failure to remove all air pressure from the inner tube could result in serious injury.<br/>Using aftermarket tires or inner tubes, not provided by Jasion may void your warranty, create an unsafe riding condition, or damage to your bike.</p>",
